## To-Do
<!-- Nothing to be done!! -->
* ~~Add `node* appendList()` function~~
### Note
* **NO** `malloc` calls to create nodes.  
    Use `makeNode()` **ALWAYS**

### Guidelines
Just there to remind you what is to be done.  
Fill with pending edits.  
Use strikethrough to check off things that are done.  
Empty the list when everything is done.
